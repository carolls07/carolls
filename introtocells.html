        <h1>Introduction to Cells</h1>

            Have you wonder what you are composed of?

            We humans are composed of cells. Cell are something that is really important. In the year of 1650s the cell theory is discovered. 


            The cell theory started to develop because of the discovery of microscope who was discovered by 2 scientists called Anton van Leeuwenhoek (Holland) and Robert Hooke (England). Both of them made the microscope independently, this means that they made it separately. Just when Anton Van Leeuwenhoek is done making his own version of microscope, he directly observe many things. 
            
            
            He was the first person who observed single-celled organisms.

            Some of the examples he observed are blood cells from humans and dogs, pond water, sour milk, semen, etc. He found out small organelles when he observed the pond water. He then called them animalcules because they look like small animals. He ever made a sensation because he stated that sperm cells contain tiny human beings. 

            You guys maybe asking, where do you get the name "cells" for cells? Cells are called "cells" because of Robert Hooke's discovery. In 1665, he discovered cells when he was looking at a thin slice of cork through the microscope he made. In the thin slice of cork, he noticed little units that made up the slice of cork. These units reminded him of cells that monks lived in and decided to call it "cells". He described the cells as tin boxes or honeycomb. He thought that cells are only found in plants and fungi, but Anton Van Leeuwenhoek found out that cells are found in both animal cells and plant cells.

            After this discovery there are some theories that stated that there are living things that can spontaneously appear from nonliving material. One of the example is like mice could be created spontaneously by putting grain in dark quiet place and leaving it for a few weeks. This theory was made by John Needham. Francesco Redi, Lazzaro Spallanzani, and Louis Pasteur disagree with this theory. The three of them tried to do experiment to prove that this theory is wrong. 

            Redi made an experiment involving 2 jar containing rotting meat, one with a cover and one without a cover. His hypothesis is " If a jar containing rotting meat is covered, then it will produce no flies". The conclusion supports his hypothesis, which is that flies won't grow if they can't lay eggs on the meat. However, many people rejected his claim. Their reasoning is that sealing the jar prevented a magical essence from entering the rotting meat and bringing it to life.

        <p5>
            After that Spallanzani also tried to prove the spontaneous generation theory by redoing the experiment of John Needham. He believed that microbes that spoils food comes from the air and can be killed by boiling. His hypothesis is " If air is allowed to reach food, then microbes will get in and cause it to spoil." The experiment uses 2 flasks, one have boiled broth with the sealed open and another one boiled broth with the sealed shut. There are also objections to Spallanzani's experiment. They said that sealing the flask shut blocked the entrance of a magical life force in the air from getting to the broth. There are people who believed him because they had seen these microbes. 

            The next person to doubt and disprove John Needham's theory is Louis Pasteur. Do you know pasteurize milk? Thanks to Pasteur the pasteurize milk was made. He invented the Pasteurisation, it is when there are sterilisation by heat. He proved that heat can be used to sterilize foods and preserve them in sealed glass containers and later cans. In his experiment to disprove John Needham's theory, he improves Spallanzani's work. He uses special "swan-neck flasks" that allowed air in but traps bacteria. His hypothesis is " If the boiled broth is kept free of bacteria then it will not spoil even if air can reach it." He is the father of modern microbiology. He proved the last part of the cell theory which is "Cell only come from preexisting cells."

            In the development of cell theory there are more scientists such as Matthias Schleiden, Theodor Schwann, Rudolf Virchow, etc. In 1838, Matthias Schleiden who was a German Botanist concluded that all plant parts are made of cells. In 1 year, 1839, Theodor Schwann a German physiologist who was a close friend to Schleiden stated that all animal tissues are composed of cells. In 1858, Rudolf Virchow a German physician concluded that cells arise from preexisting cells after extensive study of cellular pathology. Then in the late 1870s, doctors start washing their hands and instruments before operating. One of the reason is because scientists who proved Ignaz Semmelweis's discovery about washing hands before helping mothers deliver their babies. At Semmelweis's time he doesn't have a concrete evidence about his discovery. He found this discoveries when he realized that lesser mothers died when he washed his hands before operations. He tried to tell other doctors, but they said he was crazy and didn't want to listen to him. After he died the scientists tried to dig deeper his discoveries and found out it is true. After sometime there is modern cell theory. It contains 4 statements which are additions to the original Cell Theory.  The cell contains hereditary information (DNA) which is passed on from cell to cell during cell division. 
            All cells are basically the same in chemical composition and metabolic activities. 
            All basic chemical & physiological functions are carried out inside the cell. (movement, digestion, etc.) 
            Cell activity depends on the activities of subcellular structures within the cell (organelles, nucleus, plasma membrane).
